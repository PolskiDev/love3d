Löve3D engine (forked from g3d) simplifies [LÖVE](http://love2d.org)'s 2D capabilities for 3D games to be as simple to use as possible. We recommend to use Blender (open source software ) to build the 3D models for using inside Löve3D games, and it has full interoperability with Löve2D source code.

You can add pieces of code from Löve2D into Löve3D with no working problems.

## Features

- 3D Model rendering
- Blender __.obj__ file loading
- Camera collisions into 3D rendered entities
- Both 3D rendered entities collisions
- Custo collision field
- Basic first person movement and camera controls
- Perspective and orthographic projections
- Easily create your own custom vertex and fragment shaders
- Basic collision functions
- Simple, commented, and organized
- Fully documented, check out the [Löve3D wiki](http://love3d.gabrielmargarido.org) or [g3d wiki](https://github.com/groverburger/g3d/wiki)!

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest release version.
2. Add the `love3d` subfolder folder to your project.
3. Add `love3d = require "love3d"` to the top of your `main.lua` file.  
4. You can also add `Gamestate = require 'love3d.hump.gamestate'`  
to create custom [gamestates](https://hump.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gamestate.html).
